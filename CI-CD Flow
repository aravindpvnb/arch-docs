Creating a CI/CD architecture for deploying machine learning (ML) models on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using GitHub Actions and Harness involves several components. Below is a description of the architecture, followed by a textual representation.

### Components

1. **GitHub Repository**: Source code for the ML model, including training scripts, model files, and configuration.

2. **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI process by building, testing, and packaging the model.

3. **Harness**: Orchestrates the CD process, enabling deployment of the ML model to GCP.

4. **GCP Services**: Services where the ML model is deployed (e.g., AI Platform, Cloud Run, or Kubernetes Engine).

5. **Artifact Storage**: A storage solution (like Google Cloud Storage or Artifact Registry) to store trained models or Docker images.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Tools for monitoring model performance and logging outputs (e.g., Stackdriver, Prometheus).

### Workflow Description

1. **GitHub Repo**:
   - Developers push code or create pull requests, which trigger workflows defined in GitHub Actions.

2. **GitHub Actions**:
   - **Build and Test**: Run scripts to build the model, validate code quality, and run tests.
   - **Package**: Package the trained model and push it to artifact storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage or Artifact Registry).

3. **Artifact Storage**:
   - Store the packaged ML model artifacts. This could include model files, Docker images, or any other dependencies.

4. **Harness**:
   - Orchestrates the deployment of the ML model.
   - Pulls the latest artifacts from storage and deploys them to the specified GCP service.

5. **GCP Services**:
   - Deploy the model to AI Platform, Cloud Run, or Kubernetes Engine, depending on the application architecture.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - After deployment, monitoring tools track the model's performance, logging services capture logs, and provide insights for troubleshooting.

### Example CI/CD Pipeline Steps

1. **CI Steps (GitHub Actions)**:
   - Triggered on push or pull request.
   - Build the model environment (e.g., install dependencies).
   - Train the model and validate performance.
   - Save the trained model to artifact storage.

2. **CD Steps (Harness)**:
   - Triggered after CI success.
   - Pull the latest model artifact from storage.
   - Deploy the model to the chosen GCP service.
   - Execute any post-deployment validation tests.

### Visual Diagram

To create a visual representation, you can use diagramming tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or any preferred software to illustrate the architecture. Use boxes for each component and arrows to show the flow of actions and data.

### Conclusion

This architecture facilitates a seamless CI/CD process for deploying ML models on GCP, ensuring efficient automation from code commits to production deployment, with Harness managing the continuous delivery aspect and GitHub Actions handling the continuous integration. Monitoring and logging provide visibility into the model's performance post-deployment, allowing for continuous improvement.
