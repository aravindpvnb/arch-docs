To authorize users to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services using PingFederate, you need to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) and establish a trust relationship between PingFederate as your identity provider (IdP) and GCP as the service provider (SP). Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### Step 1: Set Up PingFederate as an Identity Provider

1. **Install and Configure PingFederate:**
   - Ensure PingFederate is installed and configured in your environment. It should be set up as an Identity Provider (IdP).

2. **Create an IdP Connection:**
   - Log in to the PingFederate administration console.
   - Navigate to **Identity Provider > Identity Provider Connections**.
   - Create a new connection and configure the settings as needed, including any SAML profiles required.

3. **Configure SAML Attributes:**
   - Define the SAML attributes that will be used for authorization, such as user email, roles, or groups.
   - Ensure these attributes are mapped correctly from your identity store (e.g., Active Directory).

### Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Platform as a Service Provider

1. **Create a SAML App in GCP:**
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Workload Identity Federation**.
   - Set up a new identity provider and select **SAML** as the protocol.

2. **Configure the SAML IdP:**
   - Enter the required SAML metadata from PingFederate, including the SAML entity ID and SSO URL.
   - Upload the PingFederate certificate to verify the signature.

3. **Configure IAM Roles and Permissions:**
   - Define IAM roles in GCP that the SAML users will have access to.
   - Set up role mappings between the SAML attributes (e.g., groups or roles) and GCP IAM roles.

### Step 3: Establish Trust Between PingFederate and GCP

1. **Exchange Metadata:**
   - Export the metadata from PingFederate and import it into GCP.
   - Export the metadata from GCP and import it into PingFederate.

2. **Configure Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL:**
   - Ensure the ACS URL from GCP is correctly configured in PingFederate.
   - The ACS URL tells PingFederate where to send the SAML assertion after authentication.

3. **Configure SSO URLs:**
   - Set the Single Sign-On (SSO) URL in PingFederate to point to the GCP SSO endpoint.
   - Ensure that the logout URLs are also configured if you want users to be logged out of both GCP and PingFederate at the same time.

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Initiate a Test Login:**
   - Attempt to log in to GCP using the SSO link configured with PingFederate.
   - Check if the SAML authentication flow redirects you correctly and logs you into the GCP console.

2. **Verify Role Assignment:**
   - Ensure that the correct IAM roles are assigned to the authenticated users based on the SAML attributes.
   - Check that users have the appropriate permissions to access GCP services.

3. **Troubleshoot as Needed:**
   - Review the SAML assertion in case of errors to ensure attributes and configuration are correct.
   - Check logs in both PingFederate and GCP to diagnose any issues with the SSO setup.

### Best Practices

- **Secure Your Connections:** Ensure that your SAML connections are secured with encryption and that certificates are regularly updated.
- **Monitor and Audit:** Set up monitoring and logging for authentication events to detect any unauthorized access attempts.
- **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update both PingFederate and GCP components to benefit from security patches and new features.

By following these steps, you can successfully authorize users to GCP services using PingFederate, providing seamless SSO and robust access management.
